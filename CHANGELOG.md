# Free-library expansion · 2026-10-03

- Expanded from **841 to 3,883 scores**, adding **3,042** playable entries: **1,828 O’Neill GPL transcriptions**, **272 individually declared public-domain Open Hymnal upper voices**, and **942 additional Mutopia editions**.
- Added collection and exact-edition-license filters, contributor search, and distinct public-domain/licensed-edition labels. Preserved actual CC versions and GPL-2.0-or-later permissions.
- Retained contributor credits, per-edition provenance, original PDFs/MIDI/editable sources, source hashes, Open Hymnal’s complete original ABC, and O’Neill’s contributor/copyright/GPL notices.
- ABC export/reimport retains rights metadata without multiplying notices. MIDI exports add credit and editable-source events without changing the music; SVG exports cover all rendered sections with visible credits and source metadata; print retains notices and adds a GPL source/license appendix.
- GPL original downloads bundle the unchanged ABC with attribution and license documents.
- Preserved all original 841 IDs and ABC, note dragging, source-text selection, chosen-measure playback, percentage-speed playback, and both original localStorage keys.
- Updated the rights manifest, README, source investigation/exclusion logs, and validation report. All 3,883 scores passed rendering, playback/MIDI, and transposition checks; original asset hashes and legacy browser storage checks passed.
- Investigated the Public Domain Song Anthology through official Dataverse, Fulcrum, and UVA downloads. Those byte endpoints returned HTTP 403, so no anthology placeholders or songs are counted.

# Latest update · 2026-10-03

- Expanded the library from 212 to 841 scores, adding 629 verified public-domain source editions with complete local PDFs/MIDI and retained declarations and hashes.
- Added vertical pitch dragging, including chord groups and transposing/bass displays.
- Fixed sheet clicks selecting the wrong ABC text by mapping musical events back to original source positions.
- Added start-at-measure controls and selection by clicking a note, with pickups/repeats/ties supported.
- Added independent 25–200% playback speed and reset to 100%, retaining the original Q: tempo and MIDI export tempo. Live changes resume at the current position.
- Preserved existing storage keys and catalog IDs for saved scores and favorites.
- Added real-engraving and native-browser regression tests.

# FretFree · Expanded library

- Renamed CommonNote to FretFree.
- Added 200 editions explicitly declared Public Domain by Mutopia, for 212 total scores.
- Bundled complete unchanged source PDF scores and original MIDI files, plus editable upper-part practice studies of up to 32 bars.
- Included per-edition rights records, source evidence snapshots, and file hashes.
- Added genre filters, title/composer sorting, common-title aliases, and 24-score pagination.
- Kept the previous browser-storage namespace so existing saved scores and favorites remain accessible on the same website address.
- Verified all 212 scores' parsing, MIDI generation, transposition, and source-pitch register; source asset integrity; library controls and legacy saves.

Complete source PDFs preserve the music as published by Mutopia. Editable practice studies omit accompaniment and expressive markings, and quantize rhythms to sixteenth notes. They are labeled as studies, not complete arrangements.
